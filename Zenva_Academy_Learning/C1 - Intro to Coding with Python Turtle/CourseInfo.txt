Course Name: Intro to Coding with Python Turtle
"Difficulty": Entry Level 

Thoughts upon finish:

This was actually really cool and showed me a library that I did not 
know existed which allows a user to create digital art using Python!

The course's instructions were really good, and allowed me to quickly understand
what was going on. I was able to easily complete the final project without
anything but a deisgn requirment. Although, they do go over it step by step too!
