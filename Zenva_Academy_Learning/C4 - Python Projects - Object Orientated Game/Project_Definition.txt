We want to build an escape room game in Python
 - Room contains several objects
 - Player can interact with objects
 - Player needs a code to escape
 - Objects provide clues about the code

Players will need to gather all the clues to get the code and escape the room.
 - Each item can be looked at, smelled, or touched
 - Each sense provides new information
 - Players discern information based on the interations
