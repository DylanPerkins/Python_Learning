Our game will be entirely text-based
 - Will be run in the terminal
 - Print prompts in the console and capture user input
 - Will run until the player wins or loses
 - Player will win if they guess the code right
 - Player will lose if they guess incorrectly 3 times


Game Components

 - Room Object
    - A room!
    - Consists of the excape code and a list of game objects (items in the room)
 - Game
    - Keeps track of one room
    - Keeps track of the number of guesses the player has made
