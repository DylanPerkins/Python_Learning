Course Name: Python Turtle Mini-Projects
"Difficulty": Beginner

Thoughts upon finish:

The inital lessons of the course mainly went over variables, operations,
conditions, and debugging which I just quickly skipped over since 
I am profiecient in them already. The final projects went very well, all 
of them were a lot of fun and helped me learn a lot about functions!
