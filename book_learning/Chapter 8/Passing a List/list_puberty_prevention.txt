Section: Preventing a Function from Modifying a List

Sometimes, you’ll want to prevent a function from modifying a list.

For example, if you have a list of numbers, and you want to pass it to a function that finds 
the largest number in the list, you don’t want the function to change the actual list.

You can address this issue by passing the function a copy of the list, not the original. 
Any changes the function makes to the list will affect only the copy, leaving the original list intact.

You do this like the following;
function_name(list_name[:])

Note that this is done when calling the function, not in the function definition.

The slice notation [:] makes a copy of the list to send to the function.

You usually want to avoid sending copies to a function, but at times it may be beneficial.
